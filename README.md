# Johnatan Urbano personal web site

This is my personal website built using ReactJS and Bulma as the CSS framework. [Live here](https://johnatan.dev)

The personal information on the website is populated from a json file that follows the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) open source standard.

## Customizing it

Feel free to fork this project and update it with your own information and style. Just update the Â´src/resume.jsonÂ´ with your personal information.

If you improve the app in any way a PR would be very apreciated ;)

## Build

1. Clone the repo:
```console
> git clone https://github.com/alexurguz/personal-page.git
```

2. Update the *resume.json* with your personal information (check [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/))

3. Install dependencies and run build command:
```console
> npm install
> npm run build
```

You can also test the app with a development server, just run:

```console
> npm start
```
